# Product Landing Page

![Product Landing Page](https://github.com/erolaliyev/product-landing-page/blob/master/images/product-landing-page.png)

* User stories:
  * My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding `id="header"`.
  * I can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. A company logo would make a good image here.
  * Within the `#header` element I can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.
  * I can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.
  * When I click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
  * I can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.
  * My landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
  * Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where I can enter an email address.
  * The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
  * The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
  * Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
  * When I click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
  * The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
  * My product landing page should have at least one media query.
  * My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

* Stack:
  * HTML
  * CSS(Flexbox)
